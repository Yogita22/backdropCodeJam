## Story Tellers in you have a wonderful chance now !

## Back Me Up.

Add a Flavor to XT Summit 17 by creating an interactive backdrop for "The" Show.!

## Elaboration

We are looking for our technologists to be story tellers too. We have a problem of not wanting a static back drop for XT Summit 2017 but do not want the talks/speaker to not have a flavor. We need our jammers to bring in a character to the stage.
Currently we have branding assets from Sapient Razorfish , XT Summit 2017 ready for you guys to make use of. Now that you have a start to dream about. We want your story telling abilities to take an upper hand and your technology drive your creativity to a tangible final point. Go for the juggle!
